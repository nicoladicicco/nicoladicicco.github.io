I am a final-year PhD Student in Telecommunications at Politecnico di Milano under the supervision of [Prof. Massimo Tornatore](https://tornatore.faculty.polimi.it).

My work is mostly focused the integration of Machine Learning with communications network optimization, management, and control. How to design intelligent learning agents that can autonomously manage and control a network? How do they compare with classical optimization techniques? I wrote a couple of papers exploring these broad questions.

I am currently collaborating with [Prof. Vittorio Degli Esposti](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/v.degliesposti/en) within [COST CA20120 INTERACT](https://interactca20120.org), and with [Prof. Walter Cerroni](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/walter.cerroni/en) for developing intelligent orchestrators for edge/fog networks.

I really enjoy videogames, with my favorites being (in no particular order) Metal Gear Solid, The Legend of Zelda, and FromSoftware games.
